# VST

A utility to change the default Windows audio device while a user-define program is running.

## Configuration
Configuration is set during the first run of the program, and may be changed by right-clicking
the tray-icon and pressing configure.

You may optionally set two Javascript transform functions to set and restore the volumes of the
audio devices. By default, the functions provided do a one to one mapping.
